You can use it as a C++ API or as a standalone scripting language to get easy and simple access to accelerated 2D and 3D graphics, hardware shaders, sound and network programming, physics engines and more.\r\n\r\nThe core Polycode API is written in C++ and can be used to create portable native applications.\r\n\r\nOn top of the core C++ API, Polycode offers a LUA-based scripting system with its own set of compilation tools. The LUA API mirrors the C++ API and can be used to easily create prototypes and even publish complete applications to multiple platforms without compiling C++.\r\n\r\nPolycode is available under the MIT license and was designed and developed by Ivan Safrin.\r\n\r\nPlease see BUILD.md or BUILD.txt for instructions on how to build Polycode from source.\r\n"}
